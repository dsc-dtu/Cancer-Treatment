2338680,2007,2,12,Duodenum: [x]Normal []Other: Major ampulla: [x]Found in normal position []Not found Biliary cannulation: [x]Successful []Unsuccessful []Not attempted Instrument used: The CBD was suucessfully cannulated with a standard sphincterotome and 0.035 guidewire via the prior precut site. Pancreatic cannulation: [x]Successful []Unsuccessful []Not attempted Instrument used: A pancreatic stent placed during last ERCP was seen in good position. Cannulation via 0.035 guidewire of the pancreatic duct was performed alongside the stent without difficulty. Cholanigogram: Diffusely dilated common bile duct without any filling defects. The cause of the CBD dilation is due to fibrosis from chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatogram: The main pancreatic duct remains diffusely dilated with dilated side branches consistent with chronic pancreatitis. No filling defects were seen. The communication with prior pseudocyts is no longer seen confirming adequate pseudocyst drainage. Therapuetic procedures: A generous biliary sphincterotomy was performed with ERBE endocut settings. Following the sphincterotomy a 11-Fr 5-cm biliary stent was successfully placed with excellent drainage. A 5-Fr 5-cm pigtail pancreatic stent was placed successfully placed alongside the prior pancreatic stent without difficulty. Complications: [x]No []Yes: The patient tolerated the proceudure well and there were no immediate complications. 
2338680,2007,2,49,Duodenum: [x]Normal []Other: Major ampulla: [x]Found in normal position []Not found Biliary cannulation: []Successful [x]Unsuccessful []Not attempted Instrument used: Multiple attempts with a standard sphincterotome with guidewire assistance was unsuccessful. Needle-knife precut was made but we were still unable to gain access to the bile duct. Pancreatic cannulation: [x]Successful []Unsuccessful []Not attempted Instrument used: Standard sphincterotome with guidewire assistance Pancreatogram: The main pancreatic duct was grossly dilated along with the major radicals consistent with patient's history of chronic pancreatitis. There is communication between the PD and known pseudocyst since our guidewire crossed into the cystoduodenostomy tube. After re-positioning the guidewire a generous pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed. Excellent pancreatic drainage was seen post-sphincterotomy. Next a balloon catheter was exchanged for the sphinctertome and the pancreatic duct was swept twice. No obvious debris/stone was seen during the sweep. Finally a 7-Fr 5-cm plastic stent was placed into the pancreatic duct. The cystduodenostomy tube was removed with a rat-tooth forecep at the conclusion of the procedure. Cholanigogram: Not performed Complications: [x]No []Yes: The patient tolerated the proceudure well and there were no immediate complications.

Pancreatogram: Tortuous and dilated main pancreatic duct consistent with known chronic pancreatitis Therapuetic procedures: The biliary sphincterotomy was further extended using ERBE endocut without complications. Following sphincterotomy the pancreatic duct was cannulated and a balloon catheter was passed into the main pancreatic duct under guidewire assistance. The main pancreatic duct was swept once with the balloon from the body without extraction of any pancreatic debris. After the duct was swept the pancreatic sphincter was dilated multiple times using the balloon catheter without difficulty. There was no evidence of pancreatic pseudocyst. Complications: [x]No []Yes: The patient tolerated the proceudure well and there were no immediate complications.

Clinical History: Hepatitis-C. Rule out hepatoma. The gallbladder is unremarkable in position size and echotexture. No cholelithiasis wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid is seen. A junctional fold is seen in the proximal body region. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is noted. The common duct measures 0.5 cm at the porta hepatis. This is within normal limits. The pancreas is not optimally visualized especially in the head uncinate process and tail region due to obscuration by bowel. However visualized portions do not demonstrate ductal dilatation or fluid collections. There is a suggestion of mild hepatomegaly. No perihepatic fluid is seen . Significant hyperechoic hepatic heterogeneity is noted. This may reflect fatty infiltration and/or known diffuse hepatocellular disease. No sizable circumscribed hyper or hypoechoic intrahepatic mass is seen. Please note that subtle small isoechoic or infiltrative hepatic masses may potentially be obscured by intrinsic hepatic heterogeneity. In light of the clinical suspicion of hepatoma a dual-phase hepatic CT is suggested for better assessment as warranted.

3581560,2010,5,0,On endoscopic view with the sideviewing scope the mucosa of the esophagus stomach and duodenum appeared to be normal. Upon intubation of the duodenum there was a large diverticulum in the 4th portion. Within that diverticulum there was a small lipoma. The papilla was seen adjacent to this lipoma. Using an RX 44 sphincterotome the ampulla was cannulated and a 0.035 inch guidewire was passed into the common bile duct and common hepatic duct. Injection of Ultravist under fluorscopy revealed multilple large filling defects which represented bile stones in the common bile duct. The common bile duct was dilated to approximately 1cm. Given the fact that the patient had only stopped his asa/plavix only a minimal sphincterotomy was made with only minimal bleeding which resolved on its own. The sphinctertome was exchanged over a wire for a 7fr 10cm plastic boston scientific biliary stent and the stent was successfully placed over the guide wire and into the common bile duct. Free flowing clear bile was seen emanating from the stent. 
3581560,2010,8,81,Esophagus: Nothing abnormal. Stomach: Nothing abnormal. Duodenal Bulb: Nothing abnormal. Duodenum: Ampulla was in its expected position. There was a large ampulla upstream of the ampulla. Using a 44 Rx Cook sphinctertome the CBD was cannulated first in under 5 attempts. The presenceof the ampulla made it difficult in the short scope position. A cholangiogram did not reveal any obvious filling defects. A liberal sphincterotomy was performed using standard cautery setting an d a COOK fusion sphinctertome. The duct was swept with a COOk balloon occluding the entire CBD under fluoroscopy. Stones were noted to be extruding from the CBD. There was minimal self limited bleeding following the balloon sweep. There were no other complications and the atient tolerated the procedure well. A 7 cm 10 French stent was left in place in the distal CBD.

5781308,2008,6,457,Two small non-bleeding polyps were seen in the cecum and the ascending colon measuring 0.4 cm and 0.3 cm which showed no stigmata of recent hemorrhage. The first polyp was removed by snare cautery using standard settings. A cold excisional biopsy was obtained from the ascending colon. Minimal radiation changes in the rectum. Moderate internal hemorroids with irritation and erythema. There were a few small scattered diverticula present in the sigmoid. 1. Two small non-bleeding polyps in the cecum and the ascending colon. [211.3]. The first polyp was removed by snare cautery. A cold excisional biopsy was obtained from the ascending colon. 2. A few small scattered diverticula in the sigmoid. [562.10]. Hct 35 but normochromic/normocytic. Assessment: Likely radiation proctitis bleeding in trivial amounts. Suggested to patient that we could treat lesion with argon plasma coagulation if desired. Alternatively hemorrhoidal banding could be performed in Procto clinic if that was required. I think the radiation changes are more likely to cause the kind of bleeding he describes so I would try that first. As the total bleeding is very small he will think about it and call us if he decides that he would like to have something done.

6044425,2008,10,0,The esophagus was normal. There was a small amount of blood coating the entire stomach mucosa. Evidence of previous gastric surgery was evident with what appeared to be B-II anatomy. There was a large clot arising from the papilla attached to both biliary stents (which were in position draining bile) obscuring our views. Copious irrigation was performed and revealed active pulsatile bleeding from this area. We injected the surrounding area (with overlying clot) with ~ 30 cc's of 1: 10 000 epinephrine using a Carr-Locke injection needle. We also injected 20 cc's 25% albumin (1: 5 dilution with epinephrine) into the area to control the bleeding. Next a cold snare was used to remove the clot with careful attention not to remove the stents. This maximized our views and oozing was seen arising from the superior aspect of the sphincterotomy site. Additional 10 cc's of 1: 10 000 epinephrine was then injected with immediate hemostasis. The area was observed for 10 minutes and no additional active bleeding was seen.

6099077,2007,2,0,Duodenum: []Normal [x]Other: Given patient's history of Bilroth II a gastroscope was used first in attempt to locate the major ampulla. Upon entering the stomach there was evidence of a gastrojejunostomy with an end-to-side anastamosis. Both jejunal limbs were successfully intubated. The afferent and efferent loops were identified with the afferent loop being adjacent to the lesser curvature of the stomach. Pools of bile was seen in this loop whereas the other loop was devoid of bile. The afferent loop was extremely long and we could not locate the major ampulla despite careful inspection of the duodenal mucosa. At this point we switched to a duodenoscope in hopes of advancing further into the loop. At one point a small duodenal diverticulum was seen but it did not contain the major ampulla. We were still unable to locate the ampulla using the duodenoscope. During the procedure there was prompt re-accumulation of bile in the afferent loop which leads us to believe that there is at least partial if not complete biliary drainage. The procedure was aborted after numerous attempts with the duodenoscope was unsuccessful and to avoid over-distention of the GI tract.
